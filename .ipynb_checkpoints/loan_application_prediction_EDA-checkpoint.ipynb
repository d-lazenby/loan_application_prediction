    "This notebook analyses a loan dataset taken from a GitHub user ([prasertcbs](https://github.com/prasertcbs/basic-dataset)). There wasn't any extra information alongside it (e.g. we have the loan amount but not the currency or frequency, and we don't know where the data itself was taken from) but I noticed that (a) the columns were all self-explanatory and (b) there were relatively few rows (only 614), and I was wondering if it would be possible to train a model to predict whether a given loan would be approved with such a small sample.
